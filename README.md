# Seattle-Public-Library-Library-Checkout-Data

This repository holds both an R Script used to pull the SPL Checkouts by Title data from the Socrata API -- labelled Month_Loop_SPL.R, and a Python Notebook that holds the code used to recreate the dataframe used for our analysis in our paper. We don't host any data snapshot on this GitHub because of data size.
